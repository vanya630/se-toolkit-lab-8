## What is an LLM

An LLM (Large Language Model) is a type of AI model trained on large amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-readable text, including code.

LLMs power [coding agents](./coding-agents.md#what-is-a-coding-agent) that help you complete tasks in this course.

## Model

A model is a specific trained version of an [LLM](#llm), identified by a name (e.g., `Qwen3-Coder`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`).

Different models vary in capability, speed, and cost. [Coding agents](./coding-agents.md#choose-and-use-a-coding-agent) let you choose which model to use.

### Free models

[`OpenRouter`](https://openrouter.ai/) provides [free models](https://openrouter.ai/collections/free-models).

## Token

A token is a unit of text that an [LLM](#llm) processes — roughly a word or a few characters.

LLMs read and generate text token by token. The number of tokens in a message affects how much of the [context window](#context-window) it uses.

## Context

The context is the information available to the [LLM](#llm) during an interaction — your messages, the conversation history, and any files or instructions you provide.

### Context window

The context window is the maximum amount of text (measured in [tokens](#token)) that an [LLM](#llm) can process in a single interaction — including the conversation history, files, and the current message.

When the context window is full, earlier parts of the conversation are dropped. To avoid this, keep conversations focused and start a new conversation when switching tasks.

## Context engineering

Context engineering is the practice of deliberately choosing what information to include in the context to get better results from an LLM.

When using a [coding agent](./coding-agents.md#what-is-a-coding-agent), you control the [context](#context) by referencing specific files, pasting error messages, and providing acceptance criteria. The more relevant the context, the more useful the response.

## Prompt

A prompt is the input text you send to an LLM to guide its response. The quality of the prompt directly affects the quality of the output.

See [Prompt engineering](#prompt-engineering).

## Prompt engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of writing prompts that produce accurate, relevant, and useful responses.
